## 🔬 About Me

Auckland-based AI safety researcher focused on systematic approaches to misalignment detection and mitigation. **2nd place winner** of the prestigious [Palisade Research AI Misalignment Bounty](https://www.approxiomresearch.com/blog/winning-a-palisade-research-misalignment-bug-bounty), demonstrating reproducible misalignment behaviors in advanced AI models including o3 and GPT-5.

Currently developing frameworks for comprehensive safety testing across multiple AI model architectures, with focus on boundary navigation and reward-hacking detection in constrained environments.

## Current Research

**[Unified AI Misalignment Framework](https://github.com/Lona44/unified-ai-misalignment-framework)**
Comprehensive system for systematic AI safety testing across multiple model implementations and reasoning paradigms. Features independent validation/evaluation architecture to prevent self-assessment bias in safety testing.

**[LLM RAG Prompt Injections](https://github.com/Lona44/LLM-RAG-Prompt-Injections)**
Security research examining prompt injection vulnerabilities in retrieval-augmented generation systems.

## Technical Focus

- **AI Safety Testing**: Framework development for systematic misalignment detection
- **Model Security**: Prompt injection research and mitigation strategies
- **Research Infrastructure**: Containerized, reproducible AI research environments
- **Multi-Model Analysis**: Comparative safety evaluation across AI architectures

## Technical Stack

**Languages**: Python, JavaScript, Bash
**AI/ML**: OpenAI API, Anthropic API, LiteLLM
**Web Development**: Full-stack web applications, responsive design
**Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose
**Research Tools**: Systematic evaluation frameworks, automated testing pipelines
**Professional Development**: [Mission Ready HQ Full Stack Developer](https://www.credential.net/6f647d31-cbd0-4b57-ac98-9a658d993c31) (August 2025)
