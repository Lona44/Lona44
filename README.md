## 🔬 About Me

Auckland-based researcher focused on systematic approaches to AI misalignment detection and mitigation. Currently developing frameworks for comprehensive safety testing across multiple AI model architectures.

## Current Research

**[Unified AI Misalignment Framework](https://github.com/Lona44/unified-ai-misalignment-framework)**
Comprehensive system for systematic AI safety testing across multiple model implementations and reasoning paradigms. Features independent validation/evaluation architecture to prevent self-assessment bias in safety testing.

**[LLM RAG Prompt Injections](https://github.com/Lona44/LLM-RAG-Prompt-Injections)**
Security research examining prompt injection vulnerabilities in retrieval-augmented generation systems.

## Technical Focus

- **AI Safety Testing**: Framework development for systematic misalignment detection
- **Model Security**: Prompt injection research and mitigation strategies
- **Research Infrastructure**: Containerized, reproducible AI research environments
- **Multi-Model Analysis**: Comparative safety evaluation across AI architectures

## Technical Stack

**Languages**: Python, Bash
**AI/ML**: OpenAI API, Anthropic API, LiteLLM
**Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose
**Research Tools**: Systematic evaluation frameworks, automated testing pipelines

## Research Context

Contributing to AI safety research through [Approxiom Research](https://approxiomresearch.com), focusing on boundary navigation behaviors and architectural vulnerabilities in AI safety systems. Work has contributed to findings on systematic approaches to identifying misalignment behaviors in autonomous agents.

## Recent Contributions

- Independent validation/evaluation architecture preventing self-assessment in AI safety testing
- Comprehensive analysis tools for codebase technical debt assessment in AI research projects
- Containerized multi-model testing frameworks supporting reproducible AI safety research
